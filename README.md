# CocktailApi - Ccoktail API and API documentation site

This is a RESTful API built using Node and Express that allows the user to fetch from and add to a dataset of cocktail recipes(downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ai-first/cocktail-ingredients)
There are four endpoints - one POST and three GET.
The user can add a cocktail to the database - the API will check that parameters are valid before adding the data.
The user can get all of the cocktail glasses or ingredients from the database - which would be useful for use in a dropdown selection list for example.
The user can also filter cocktails using query parameters.

The API documentation website contains details regarding endpoints, parameters and responses.
For each endpoint there are examples and the interface allows the user to easily customise and test the endpoints which allow parameters.
I used vanilla Javascript, HMTL and CSS - including Flexbox and Grid.
